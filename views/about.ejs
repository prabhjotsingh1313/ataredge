  <h1>About ATAR Edge Academy</h1>

  <div class="card">
    <p>Hello — I’m Prabhjot, founder of ATAR Edge Academy. I started tutoring while completing Year 12 and have continued since graduating in 2023. I came to Australia in 2019 with limited English, and through persistence, leadership and focused study I achieved a 97.20 ATAR and several academic honours. These experiences shaped my belief that with the right guidance every student can excel.</p>

    <p>At ATAR Edge Academy our mission is simple: give students the practical skills, confidence and exam strategies they need to reach their best ATAR results. We specialise in STEM disciplines — Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics and Digital Solutions — and combine clear explanations, targeted practice and compassionate coaching.</p>
